# PPO_From_Scratch

Proximal Policy Optimization, or PPO, is a policy gradient method for reinforcement learning. The motivation was to have an algorithm with the data efficiency and reliable performance of TRPO, while using only first-order optimization.

In 2017, Schulman et al. introduced Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), building on the TRPO foundations.


Proximal policy optimization (PPO) is the state-of the-art most effective model-free reinforcement learning algorithm. Its powerful policy search ability allows an agent to find the optimal policy by trial and error but leads to high computation and low data-efficiency.
